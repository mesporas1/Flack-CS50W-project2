# Flack-CS50W-project2

This is a slack like messaging service made for Harvard's CS50W Online Course. It utilizes Python's Flask Socket library for the backend and HTML/CSS and Javascript for the front end. Feel free to clone the repository!

If you want to run the program on your machine with Flask's Test Server, please do the following.
1. Install Python 3.6 and pip3 on your machine.
2. Using a terminal, navigate to the directory with this repository and run pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Set your environment variable FLASK_APP to application.py. On MAC or Linux, you can run export FLASK_APP = application.py. On Windows, the command is set FLASK_APP=application.py
4. Run flask run --no-reload to run the application. (--no-reload is used so that socket can run properly.)
5. Click the url provided by Flask.
